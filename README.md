# Team Paraducks | WRO Future Engineers 2024

## Introduction:
This repository provides all the information about the WRO Future Engineers 2024 Team Paraducks. The team members are Micquel Devlaliwalla, Manish Ganeshan & Aryan Pai mentored by Akshay Sir and Ajinkya Sir. We are three 10th graders studying at DAIS, Mumbai and are being mentored at The Innovation Story.

All 3 of us have prior *FIRST* Tech Challenge and *FIRST* Robotics Competition experience, and wanted to try our hands at something new!

## Rapid Prototyping

Our rapid prototyping process evolved significantly as we developed our robot. Initially, we started with the Arduino IDE and a HuskyLens for vision processing. This setup allowed us to quickly get a basic prototype up and running. However, we soon realized that the processing capabilities were insufficient for our more advanced vision and decision-making algorithms.

To address these limitations, we pivoted to a more powerful setup. We transitioned to using a Raspberry Pi 4 as our main processing unit, running Python code developed in PyCharm. This shift provided us with much more computational power and flexibility. For motor control and servo movements, we retained an ESP32 microcontroller, establishing communication between the Raspberry Pi and ESP32 via UART. This separation of concerns allowed us to leverage the strengths of both systems: the Raspberry Pi excelled at complex computations and vision processing, while the ESP32 efficiently handled low-level hardware control. This new architecture significantly improved our robot's performance and allowed us to implement more sophisticated algorithms.
